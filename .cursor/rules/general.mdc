Always use @/ imports instead of relative imports
When you need an icon, use @/components/icons/*
If an icon doesn't exist, create it using lucide using the same format as the other icons
If you need to create a component, check if you can install it or dependencies via bunx @react-native-reusables/cli@latest add
Sort all object keys and component props alphabetically
